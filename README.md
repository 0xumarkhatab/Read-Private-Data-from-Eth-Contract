# Access Private Data from Ethereum Contract

We will build a simple contract, along with a Hardhat Test, to demonstrate this. Our contract will attempt to store data in private variables hoping that nobody will be able to read it's value.

The contract will take in password and username in its contructor and will store them in private variables.

User will somehow be able to access those private variables.


> Usage 

```shell
npm install
npx hardhat test

```
